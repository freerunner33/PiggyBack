This is the basic layout for the test environment

Need server to be running on backend ready to relay any requests

All requests will be sent via buttons on some sort of dashboard
Will send default data from html forms - changable if necessary

There will be a separate page that will display the log file and error file

All requests will be to the test organization - use the test key

Button on website sends form
server catches this post request
converts to Onfleet spec and assigns to driver

At each new alert, a log is created for this task

Index file should not contain signup and all webhooks should post to my log
Need to also be listening for these webhooks
	Need to simply log when onfleet sends me the update

On backend need totally different mysql database
